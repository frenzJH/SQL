--In this project, I used the Postgre SQL dialect to query from a database that holds Netflix data.
--Netflix database is stored at the link below:
--http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/7dae0/19112

/*How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)*/
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie';

/*When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?*/
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

/*List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.*/
SELECT title, type
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY title ASC;

/*Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/
SELECT people.director, titles.title
FROM "netflix_people" people
JOIN "netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'The Starling';

/*What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE type = 'Movie' 
AND release_year =
(SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
